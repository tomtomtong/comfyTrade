   - Click **Add** or press Enter
4. To remove a symbol:
   - Click the **×** button next to it
5. Click **Close** when done

### Step 2: Use Quick Symbols

Quick symbol buttons appear in several places:

#### In the Trade Dialog
1. Click **New Trade** button
2. Look below the symbol input field
3. Click any quick symbol button
4. The symbol is instantly filled in!

#### In Node Properties
1. Double-click a trade node in the strategy builder
2. Look below the symbol input field

- **Add your favorites**: Trade gold? Add XAUUSD. Trade crypto? Add BTCUSD.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: My symbols disappeared!**
A: Your symbols are saved in your browser. If you cleared browser data, they'll reset to defaults. Just add them again.

**Q: Can I have more than 5 symbols?**
A: Yes! Add as many as you want. They'll wrap to multiple rows if needed.

**Q: The buttons don't appear**
A: Make sure you're connected to MT5 for full functionality. Some features require an active connection.

**Q: Can I reorder symbols?**
A: Not yet, but it's on the roadmap! For now, remove and re-add them in your preferred order.
